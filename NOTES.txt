I *could* find the book in the library on disk by simply doing a find for "(book_number)"
since that should be unique.  I could probably avoid using the export function entirely
and just symlink to the existing book file.  Which could eliminate the whole temporary
directory if the book file's timestamp doesn't change unless its contents actually change.

Hm...
